A web application for showcasing recommended products for different skin problems, built with NestJS and Vue.

## Features

- Browse products by skin problem category
- Filter products by price, category, and rating
- Sort products by popularity, price, or rating
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Admin interface for managing products

## Tech Stack

### Backend

- NestJS
- TypeORM
- PostgreSQL
- Passport.js (for auth)

### Frontend

- Vue 3 (Composition API)
- Vite
- Pinia (state management)
- Vue Router

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- PostgreSQL (v12 or higher)
- npm or yarn

## Setup

### Database Setup

1. Install PostgreSQL if you haven't already
2. Create a new database for the application:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE shopee_affiliate;
```

3. Create a user with appropriate permissions:

```sql
CREATE USER shopee_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE shopee_affiliate TO shopee_user;
```

### Environment Configuration

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the database connection settings:

```
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000

# Database configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_DATABASE=shopee_affiliate
```

### Installation

1. Install dependencies for both the backend and frontend:

```bash
# Install backend dependencies
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend && npm install
```

### Database Initialization

Seed the database with sample products:

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

Run both the frontend and backend in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:

- Backend server on http://localhost:3000
- Frontend dev server on http://localhost:5173

The frontend will proxy API requests to the backend automatically.

### Production Mode

Build and run the application for production:

```bash
npm run build:full
npm run start:prod
```

This will:

1. Build the backend
2. Build the frontend
3. Serve the frontend as static files from the backend

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

- `GET /api/products` - Get all products
- `GET /api/products/:id` - Get product by ID
- `GET /api/products/category/:category` - Get products by category
- `GET /api/products/skin-problem/:problem` - Get products by skin problem

   - URLs: Include http:// or https://

3. **Workflow Example**:

   - Download current products (`/api/products/excel/export`)
   - Make changes in Excel
   - Import updated file (`/api/products/excel/import`)

4. **Troubleshooting**:
   - Verify all required fields are populated
   - Check data format (numbers for numeric fields)
   - Ensure file is saved as .xlsx format

## Example Response

Successful import:
